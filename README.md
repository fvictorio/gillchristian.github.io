To run in development mode clone the repo, `cd` into the directory and:
```
npm install
npm run dev

```
_**NOTE**_: it runs on a docker container using `docker-compose` so you'll need to have it installed.

You can also run it without Docker but you'll need to have `harp` installed globally.
```
npm install -g harp
npm run harp:dev
```

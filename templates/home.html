	        <p>{ I am an Argentinian guy who believes in God, loves his fianc√©e and like to learn new things. <br>
				I am a young student who loves programming. I started Bioengineering and when I took the Introduction to Programming class I discovered a whole new world and fell in love with it. When I took the OOP/C++ class I made the decision to change my degree to Compute Science. }</p>
			<h5>My developer path</h5>
		   <p>{ Since I discovered programming I started to learn as much as I can. What I love the most is web development, currently I am learning from a variety of languages and frameworks: <span class="tag">MEAN Stack</span>, <span class="tag">Bootstrap</span>, <span class="tag">Foundation 5</span>, <span class="tag">Gulp</span>, <span class="tag">SASS</span>, <span class="tag">PostCSS</span>, <span class="tag">PHP</span>, <span class="tag">WordPress</span>, <span class="tag">MySQL</span>, and the list goes on. }</p>
